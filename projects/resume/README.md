# JSON Resume Service NG Library

JSON Resume Angular service library. Currently hardcoded via submodule with my JSON resume.

## How to run
> Globally install Angular CLI
`ng build resume`
> Locally installed Angular CLI (my preference to run many versions)
`npx ng build resume`    

# Future ambition
- Publish the resume service as an NPM package allowing anyone to use their JSON resume to build an Angular application.
    - Unit test the service for maintainability.
- Mirgate material components for each section of the JSON resume standard into the library.
    - Unit test the components for maintainability.
