# Traiforce Resume Project

A personal website for myself based on my resume.json. Allowing me to showcase my Angular skills, and have a data driven application that I can maintain the data in one location and use this application as the UI/UX that is better than the static JSON resume registry themes.

## How to run

`npm run start`

# Future ambition
- Improved styling consistencey
  - Breakpoints
- Shared module for resume components.
- Layout module for application wide header, and footer components.
- Publish the resume service as an NPM package allowing anyone to use their JSON resume to build an Angular application.
    - Unit test the service for maintainability.
- Publish material components for each section of the JSON resume standard.
    - Unit test the components for maintainability.
